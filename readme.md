> Check if site is down through [`isup.com`](http://isup.com)

Packges like [`is-github-down`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-github-down) or [`is-down`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-down) check if site is down fetching status code from your location.

Which is unreliable since site might be available but blocked for your IP.
Whereas this tool checks it through awesome [`isup.com`](http://isup.com) service which uses google servers around the world
